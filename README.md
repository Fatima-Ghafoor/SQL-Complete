# SQL Practice Repository

This repository contains my SQL practice queries from **BASIC to ADVANCED** using **MS SQL Server**.
All topics are organized step by step, without mixing concepts, for clear learning and reference.

## CONTENTS:

**1. FUNDAMENTALS:**
- Create, Use and Drop Database.
- Create, Alter and Drop Table.
- Insert data into Table.
- Select data from Table.
- Create Table Aliase.

**2. CONSTRAINTS:**
- Primary Key, Foreign Key, Unique, Check, Default.

**3. PROPERTIES:**
- Identity, Not Null, Null, Collate, Computed Column.

**4. FILTERING:**
- WHERE with Relational Operators (=, <>, !=, >, <, >=, <=).
- WHERE with Set & Range Comparison Operators (BETWEEN... AND, IN, NOT IN, ANY, SOME, ALL).
- WHERE with Logical Operators (AND, OR, NOT).
- WHERE with Pattern Matching Operators (LIKE, NOT LIKE).
- WHERE with Null Check Operators (IS NULL, IS NOT NULL).
- WHERE with Existence Predicates Operators (EXISTS, NOT EXISTS).

**5. SORTING:**
- ORDER BY with (ASC, DESC, Expressions, Column Positions).

**6. ROW LIMITING:**
- TOP, TOP n PERCENT, WITH TIES, OFFSET … FETCH NEXT, LIMIT.

**7. AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS:**
- SUM, AVG, COUNT, MIN, MAX.

**8. SET OPERATORS:**
- UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, EXCEPT.

**9. JOINS:**
- INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS, SELF.

**10. DATA MODIFICATION:**
- Update Table data by using (Basic, WHERE, JOIN, Subquery, OUTPUT).
- Delete Table data by using (Basic, WHERE, JOIN, Subquery, OUTPUT).
- Truncate Table.

**11. CASE EXPRESSIONS:**
- CASE Expression made with (WHEN … THEN … ELSE … END).
- CASE used with (SELECT, UPDATE, ORDER BY, JOIN, WHERE).

**12. SUBQUERIES:**
- Scalar Subquery.
- Multi-row Subquery (IN, ANY, ALL).
- Correlated Subquery.

**13. VIEWS:**
- Create Views (Simple, Updateable).
- Alter View (Add New Column, Change Expression Logic, Add More Columns for Display, Add Conditional Filter, Add an Alias).
- Select data from View.
- Drop View.
- Check Views of a Database.

**14. INDEXES:**
- Clustered Indexes (Basic, Composite, Unique).
- Non-Clustered Indexes (Basic, Composite, Unique).
- Indexed View.
- Select data from Indexed View.
- Drop Index.
- Check Indexes of a (Table, Database).

**15. PROGRAMMABILITY:**
- Stored Procedures (Create: with and without Parameters, Execute, Drop, Check SPs of a Database).
- User-Defined Functions: Scalar & Table-Valued (Create, Execute, Drop, Check Functions of a Database).
- Triggers: AFTER, INSTEAD OF, FOR (Create, Drop, Check Triggers of a Table & Database).
- Cursors: Static, Dynamic, Forward Only, Keyset (Declare, Open, Fetch, Close, Deallocate).
- Benefits of Programmability (Modularity, Reusability, Security).
